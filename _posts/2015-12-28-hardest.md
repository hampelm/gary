In the fall of 2014, the City of Gary was awarded $6.6 million for demolition through the Hardest Hit Fund Blight Elimination Program, the largest award in the state of Indiana. These funds go toward demolition of 379 vacant and abandoned homes (see list below), and will likely lead to additional demolitions as well, due to cost savings and efficiencies in our local demolition processes. This map shows all properties scheduled for demolition, and all completed demolitions in the Hardest Hit Fund program. Check back regularly as the City adds properties to our Hardest Hit Fund list.
